## Overview

This project was built while learning how to work with APIs in JavaScript Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

The Figma mockup was provided by Scrimba and the app was built entirely from scratch by me.

### The Challenge

#### Basic Requirements

- Choose seed color with an `<input type=‚Äúcolor‚Äù />`
- Choose color scheme mode in a `<select>` box
- Clicking button makes request to The Color API to get a color scheme
- Display the scheme colors and hex values on the page

#### Stretch Goals

- Click hex values and the color block itself to copy to clipboard

## My Process

1. Task breakdown
2. Create GitHub repo & README
3. Create project folder structure
4. Header
5. Add & style color picker
6. Add dropdown with themes
7. Input field with color amount options
8. "Get color scheme" btn
9. Send request to The Color API when "Get color scheme" btn clicked
10. Display colors + their hex codes
11. Add copy-to-clipboard feature when color/hex code clicked
12. Submit for code review
13. Fixes after code review
14. Update GitHub README

-> TODO: Error handling when using the Fetch API (https://web.dev/articles/fetch-api-error-handling)

### Built With

HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS & The Color API

### What I Learned

I've been enjoying learning how to fetch data from APIs. It makes the JavaScript projects I've been working on lately so much more interesting!

### Continued Development

I'm currently working on another app fetching data from external API. It's a Frontend Mentor challenge called devfinder, and it is a GitHub user search app. While expanding my API knowledge, I'm also learning Sass and implementing it in devfinder. Another solo project that is coming up is a Movie Watchlist app that will be fetching data from the Open Movie Database and make it possible for users to search films and save them into their own watch list.

### Resources & Tools

My app wouldn't be what it is without these awesome free tools and resources:
- The Color API: https://www.thecolorapi.com/

### Time Commitment

In total, I spent 5 hours on this project.
