## Overview

This project was built while learning how to work with APIs in JavaScript Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend).

The Figma mockup was provided by Scrimba and the app was built entirely from scratch by me.

- Choose seed color with an `<input type=‚Äúcolor‚Äù />`
- Choose color scheme mode in a `<select>` box
- Clicking button makes request to The Color API to get a color scheme
- Display the scheme colors and hex values on the page

#### Stretch Goals

- Click hex values and the color block itself to copy to clipboard
